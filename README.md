# For work with this 

It's recommended that you've gone through the [hardhat getting started documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) before proceeding here. 

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version`and get an output like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` And get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to install it with npm

> If you're familiar with `npx` and `npm` instead of `yarn`, you can use `npx` for execution and `npm` for installing dependencies.
